# Supermassive Black Hole Analysis
A collection of files useful in simulating the behavior around Supermassive Black Holes in Active Galactic Nuclei. 

## BLR-RESP
BLR-RESP was developed with the help of Peter Z. Harrington at Lawrence Berkeley Labs and Dr. C. Martin Gaskell at the University of California Santa Cruz. It simulates the movement of gas, outputting emission spectra based on the positioning of dust clouds, as well as the time-lag delays.
TODO: improve program to account for the broad wings
